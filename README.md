# Flowtorio — optimize the mess.

Tired of waiting for Jira to render its “new experimental interface”?<br>
Flowtorio is your **terminal control center** for developer tools —
a fast, **keyboard-driven workspace** that replaces slow, bloated UIs.
Connect Jira, Bitbucket, GitHub — or any adapter —
and turn everyday chaos into a consistent, minimal workflow.

No clicks. No loading spinners. No distractions — just flow.
